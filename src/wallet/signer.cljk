(ns wallet.signer
  "The custody seam of the wallet: a `Signer` OWNS key material and answers
  only with public keys and signatures; everything above this protocol —
  chain drivers, SIWE, tx assembly (wallet.chain / wallet.siwe) — is pure
  data plumbing that never sees a private key. This is the hardware-wallet
  boundary drawn in software (ADR-2608039900 decision 1, generalized from
  Cosmos to every secp256k1 chain).

  Two implementations exist:

  - `seed-signer` (here) — in-process, over a bip32 master node. DEV/TEST
    GRADE: the seed lives in this process's heap. It exists so the seam can
    be tested byte-for-byte against the legacy private-key path, and so
    small tools can run without a vault.
  - `kagi.chain-signer/signer` (kotoba-lang/kagi) — PRODUCTION custody: the
    seed lives in a kagi compartment, every `sign-digest!` passes the
    AccessGovernor and lands in the append-only ledger, and key material
    never crosses the process boundary of the vault.

  Scope, honestly: this seam covers secp256k1 digest signing — EVM txs
  (legacy + EIP-1559), SIWE/personal_sign, and anything else that signs a
  32-byte digest. UTXO transaction signing still goes through the private
  key (btc-crypto.tx computes sighashes internally and does not yet accept
  an external signature) — that refactor is named as follow-up work in the
  wallet-signer-seam ADR, not silently absent."
